# Social Media

Welcome to your Social Media Platform project! This platform, reminiscent of popular social media giants like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, has been meticulously crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
My aim was to create a seamless user experience with captivating visuals, all made possible by leveraging the design resources provided by Kawsarahmmed's GitHub repository and their Firestack channel.

The platform is designed to be fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
